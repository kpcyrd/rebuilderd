## Configuration for http daemon
#[http]
## The address to bind to. This is 127.0.0.1:8484 by default.
#bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:8484"
## Set a default endpoint for rebuildctl. This is especially useful for the sync timer.
#endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8484"

## A random cookie for administration is generated at startup and written to /var/lib/rebuilderd/auth-cookie
## You can set this to a fixed value here. Use `pwgen -1s 32` to generate one.
## rebuildctl is searching for this cookie in ~/.config/rebuilderd.conf, /etc/rebuilderd.conf and
## /var/lib/rebuilderd/auth-cookie in that order.
#[auth]
#cookie = "INSECURE"

## The auth cookie above is only used for the default endpoint.
## You can use different endpoints with `rebuildctl -H https://rebuilder.example.com status`,
## In that case you need to configure a section below if you want to attach a cookie.
#[endpoints."https://rebuilder.example.com"]
#cookie = "INSECURE"

## IMPORTANT: in production, make sure either `authorized_workers` or `signup_secret` is configured.
#[worker]
## If we have a fixed set of workers we can whitelist the keys here.
#authorized_workers = ["key1", "key2"]
## If we want to spawn new workers dynamically we can configure a sign up secret below.
## Use `pwgen -1s 32` to generate one.
#signup_secret = "INSECURE"
